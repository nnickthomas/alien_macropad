👽 🐄 🛸 ⭐ 🌙 🪐

them big green aliens they came them gone they took my cows

## Features 🐄

- Designed for the Pi Pico W
- Standalone device, not a keypad
- Open Source PCB designs (all files required to print your own PCB)
- Fits cherry-style switches (either plate or pcb mount)



## GPIO Pinout Map 🛸

The following pins on the Pi's GPIO pinouts correspond to the following switches:

| Switch  | GPIO Pin |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| SW1  | GP5 |
| SW2  | GP6  |
| SW3  | GP4  |
| SW4  | GP7  |
| SW5  | GP3  |
| SW6  | GP8 |

Please note that odd numbered switches (SW1, SW3, SW5) share a common ground and even numbered switches (SW2, SW4, SW6) share a common ground.
## Assembly ⭐

The alien macropad requires the following components:

| Component  | Amount |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cherry Style Switches | 6x |
| Raspberry Pi Pico W  | 1x  |
| Alien Macropad PCB  | 1x  |
| Top Sandwich Plate  | 1x  |
| Bottom Sandwich Plate  | 1x |
| Adhesive Rubber Feet  | 4x |

The following steps detail how to assemble the device.

1) place the PI into the U1 slot on the PCB and solder into place from the top. 
2) Place the Top Sandwich Plate on top
3) Insert switches SW1-SW6 into the slots and solder into place from the bottom.
4) Place the Bottom Sandwich Plate and secure the sandwich(top plate, PCB, bottom plate)!
5) Connect the device to another machine using a microusb cable and proceed to installation.
